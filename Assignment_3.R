#' The text file containing the list of words was created. I then used the 
#' readLines function to read the file, and assigned it to "list".

#' CR: It may be useful to explain why the suppressWarnings() function was
#' used.

#' engaged, by referring to them with their name.

#' I have decided to assign this random word to the variable "word".

#' Next I decided to make "word" all lower case for the sake of consistency.
